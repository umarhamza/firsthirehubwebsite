# Finding Your North Star: A Business Clarity Guide for Coaches and Entrepreneurs:

  

The First Piece of Information You Need to Get Out of Any Situation, And How It Applies to Business:

  

If you had to traverse a mountain, a jungle, a sea, or a desert and found yourself in the middle of it, needing to get back to an urban area, a friendly zone, a beach, a port, a village, or the nearest city, what’s the first thing you would need?

  

I’ve asked 2 former Marines ex-servicemen this question, when living in the USA and one living in the UK.

  

They’ve been in extreme environments, out at sea, deep in the desert, up in the mountains, or in freezing conditions in Antarctica. I expected them to know the answer immediately.

  

Some people say you need to know where you're going. Others say you need a map. Some believe the most important things are water, food supplies, or transportation. But let’s say you already have all of these things. What is the single most crucial piece of information you need?

  

It’s simple, it's your LOCATION!

  

Even if you’re in a city or town, when you open Google Maps, it first needs to know where you are before it can guide you to your destination. If you don’t know your current position, you can’t navigate anywhere.

  

The same applies to business.

  

Where Are You Right Now? The Key to Business Success

  

You might have a vision, an idea, and even resources, but if you don’t truly understand where you are, you’ll struggle to get where you want to go. What’s happening with you right now?

  

What is the state of your business?

  

What is your financial situation?

  

What is your mental, spiritual, and emotional disposition?

  

Are you physically and psychologically prepared for the journey ahead?

  

If you don’t know where you stand holistically, how can you possibly reach your destination?

  

Why Most People Fail in Business

  

Did you know that 99% of businesses fail and only 1% succeed?

  

One major reason is that people start without a realistic understanding of what it takes. They don’t have the right mindset, resilience, or discipline. They don’t realize the level of mental, psychological, and emotional strength required to succeed.

  

Most businesses fail before they even begin, not because of bad ideas, but because the person behind the business isn’t ready.

  

Know Your Starting Point Before Moving Forward

  

Before setting goals, before planning strategies, before even thinking about scaling, identify your current position. This will determine what steps you need to take next.

  

The most successful entrepreneurs are not the ones with the best ideas, but the ones who truly understand themselves, their circumstances, and their ability to navigate challenges.

  
  
  

The Importance of Having an Expert Guide When Traversing the Desert

  

The desert is one of the most unforgiving environments on Earth. With its vast, featureless landscapes, extreme temperatures, and limited resources, it is easy to lose direction, run out of supplies, or succumb to the elements. This is why having an expert guide is not just a convenience, but a matter of survival and success.

  

1\. Navigational Expertise

  

Without clear landmarks, deserts can disorient even the most prepared travelers. An expert guide:

✅ Knows how to use the sun, stars, wind patterns, and terrain for direction.

✅ Understands how sand dunes shift, avoiding paths that could lead you deeper into the wilderness.

✅ Can identify hidden landmarks that indicate nearby settlements or water sources.

  

2\. Survival Knowledge

  

The desert is ruthless—temperatures can soar during the day and drop drastically at night. A guide ensures that you:

✅ Conserve water and energy by traveling at the right times.

✅ Avoid heat exhaustion by understanding when to rest and when to move.

✅ Find natural shelters to protect against sun exposure and sandstorms.

  

3\. Resource Management

  

An expert guide knows how to ration supplies efficiently. Without proper planning, dehydration and starvation can set in quickly. A guide:

✅ Identifies water sources that are invisible to the untrained eye.

✅ Knows which plants or animals can provide food and hydration.

✅ Understands the safest places to rest, reducing the risk of exposure and exhaustion.

  

4\. Safety from Hidden Dangers

  

Many people assume the desert is just sand, but it is filled with unseen threats. A guide:

✅ Protects you from dangerous wildlife like snakes, scorpions, and predators.

✅ Helps you avoid quicksand-like areas where you could sink into loose sand.

✅ Knows how to handle sudden sandstorms that can cause instant disorientation.

  

5\. Experience in Crisis Management

  

If something goes wrong your vehicle breaks down, supplies run low, or you fall ill, a guide can:

  

✅ Signal for rescue using methods

known to locals and emergency services.

  

✅ Treat dehydration, sunstroke, or injuries with proper first-aid knowledge.

  

✅ Adapt and reroute the journey based on changing conditions.

  

Business Lesson: Why You Need a Guide in Entrepreneurship

  

Starting a business is much like crossing a desert. If you try to navigate alone without guidance, you risk:

❌ Wasting time and money on the wrong paths.

❌ Burning out due to lack of preparation.

❌ Making critical mistakes that could have been avoided.

  

Just as an expert guide increases your chances of survival and success in the desert, a business mentor or consultant helps you:

✅ Avoid common pitfalls.

✅ Navigate challenges with confidence.

✅ Use the best strategies to reach your goal faster and with fewer risks.

  

## Introduction: Why Clarity Matters

Every successful business starts with a clear purpose. If you’re feeling overwhelmed or unsure about your next steps, you’re not alone. Many business coaches and entrepreneurs struggle with identifying their ideal audience and refining their services. Without clarity, it’s easy to waste time, resources, and energy chasing the wrong opportunities.

This guide will help you pinpoint where you are in your business journey, define your audience, and refine your offerings so that you can attract the right clients and grow effectively.

## Step 1: Identifying Where You Are in Your Business Journey

Understanding your current business stage is key to knowing what to focus on next. Below are the five stages most businesses go through. Identify where you are to determine your next action steps:

### 1\. Idea Stage (Pre-launch)

*   You have a business concept but haven’t started offering services yet.
    
*   Your focus: Market research, validating demand, and refining your offer.
    

### 2\. Start-Up Stage (Early growth)

*   You have a few clients but are still figuring things out.
    
*   Your focus: Defining your audience, refining your service model, and testing different strategies.
    

### 3\. Growth Stage (Gaining traction)

*   You’re consistently getting clients, but you feel stretched thin.
    
*   Your focus: Streamlining services, increasing pricing, and improving efficiency.
    

### 4\. Scaling Stage (Expansion)

*   You’re ready to automate, delegate, and optimize for bigger growth.
    
*   Your focus: Building a team, refining your client journey, and creating scalable offers.
    

### 5\. Established Stage (Sustained success)

*   You have a well-oiled business and are looking for ways to innovate.
    
*   Your focus: Expanding your impact, developing new revenue streams, and mentoring others.
    

Once you identify your stage, focus on what will move you forward instead of getting distracted by things that don’t align with your business needs.

* * *

## Step 2: Defining Your Ideal Client

One of the biggest mistakes entrepreneurs make is trying to serve everyone. To grow effectively, you need to focus on a specific audience. Here’s how to define your ideal client:

### 1\. Identify Common Traits

Ask yourself:

*   Who are the people I enjoy working with the most?
    
*   What industry are they in?
    
*   What challenges do they face?
    

### 2\. Understand Their Pain Points

Your ideal client has specific struggles. What are they? Some examples:

*   Business coaches: Struggling to attract clients.
    
*   Entrepreneurs: Unsure how to scale beyond a certain point.
    

### 3\. Define How You Help Them

What transformation do you provide? Example:

*   Before working with you: Overwhelmed and stuck.
    
*   After working with you: Clear strategy, consistent clients, and structured business model.
    

### 4\. Create a Client Avatar

Summarize your ideal client in one paragraph. Example: "I help early-stage business coaches who struggle with finding consistent clients. They need a clear marketing strategy and a structured way to scale their coaching business."

With this clarity, your marketing and messaging will become more effective, helping you attract the right clients effortlessly.

* * *

## Step 3: Refining Your Offerings for Sustainable Growth

Once you know your audience, the next step is to refine your services so they align with your ideal client’s needs.

### 1\. Focus on Your Core Offer

Instead of offering a variety of services, focus on a core offer that delivers the best results.

*   Example: Instead of general coaching, offer a structured 12-week Business Accelerator Program.
    

### 2\. Create a Simple Value Ladder

Offer services at different levels to attract and retain clients:

*   Low-ticket: Free guides, webinars, or strategy calls.
    
*   Mid-ticket: Group coaching or digital courses.
    
*   High-ticket: One-on-one consulting or premium mastermind programs.
    

### 3\. Streamline Your Process

Create repeatable systems to ensure a seamless client experience. Automate onboarding, invoicing, and client follow-ups to save time and improve efficiency.

* * *

## Step 4: Scaling with Confidence

Now that you have clarity on your audience and services, it’s time to scale your business. Here’s how:

### 1\. Automate & Delegate

*   Use tools like CRM systems to manage client interactions.
    
*   Outsource admin tasks to a virtual assistant so you can focus on strategy.
    

### 2\. Build Authority & Trust

*   Publish valuable content (blogs, videos, social media posts) that speaks to your ideal client’s pain points.
    
*   Share testimonials and success stories to build credibility.
    

### 3\. Focus on Lead Generation

*   Run targeted ads to attract the right audience.
    
*   Network in relevant communities to build relationships and partnerships.
    

Scaling isn’t about doing more work—it’s about optimizing what’s already working.

* * *
