    review: `
    Good afternoon, folks! My name is Greg Dahl, and I want to give a big shout-out and testimonial to my friend Ismael from First Hire Hub.

I can't recommend him enough! He recently helped me prepare for launching a community for men who are in toxic, narcissistic relationships—a subject I'm passionate about because of my personal experiences.

What stood out to me was how Ismael went the extra mile. He didn't just listen; he challenged me. He wanted to truly understand my level of knowledge on the topic. His approach—honest, straightforward, and constructive—was exactly what I needed. Steel sharpens steel, and that's precisely what he brought to the table.

We even did some role-playing during a simple Q&A call, which helped me refine my vision. And after the session, Ismael went above and beyond by sending me resources and documents to support the launch of my community.

This man genuinely cares and will go that extra mile for you. I highly recommend working with him. Thanks again, Ismael!

Have a great day!


Gregory Dahl

    title: "He has truly been a game-changer!",
    review: `
Ismael Fraser has been coaching me daily, and his insights have been a complete game-changer.
I've worked with three different coaches and have been part of two other paid communities in the past. I thought I had my offer dialed in until we started this one-on-one coaching.

He helped me realise that I was targeting the wrong audience, guided me in narrowing it down, and helped me get laser-focused. Now, we're working on refining my offer. His approach is honest, strategic, and genuinely impactful.

The value he provides is incredible I know I should be paying much more for it. However, because of his integrity and honesty, he doesn't just raise his prices based on the immense value he's delivering.

If you're a business coach looking to level up, I highly recommend working with Ismael and First Hire Hub.

I cannot recommend him enough he has truly been a game-changer.

    title: "Ismael Fraser's mentorship",
    review: `
Before Ismael Fraser's mentorship, I was stuck working for others, unsure how to break free and pursue my aspirations. I lacked confidence, clarity, and direction to start something of my own. But with Ismael's guidance, everything changed.

Over three transformative years, he taught me how to create a clear roadmap, stay focused, and take consistent action. His support helped me overcome challenges, unlock my potential, and, by Allah's grace, transition from an employee to a successful educational entrepreneur.

Today, I run a thriving business with momentum, a solid foundation, and a system that attracts paying students and 5-star reviews. What once felt like a distant dream is now a reality.

I can't recommend Ismael enough—his mentorship is invaluable for anyone ready to transform their life and achieve their goals.

I've started with him from the very beginning where he helped me choose a brand name for my company.

He helped me to edit my website and gave me a lot of pointers I'm very very happy with working with him my business which has improved a lot.
